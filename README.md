# GyazoThumbs
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Team-Fruit/GyazoThumbs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Team-Fruit/GyazoThumbs)  
Simple command-line tool to get thumbs from Gyazo

## Requirements
- Java7 or later

## Installation
Create a working folder and place the jar file.

## How It Works
The command-line front-end of Gyazo Thumbs, "GyazoThumbs", download thumbnails of all the images stored in Gyazo. All thumbnails will be JPEG and the image will be degraded, but **this works even if the account is not Pro.** Also, if your account is Pro, you can also download raw images. You can specify the directory to download, number of photos to get, and whether to download only new photos since last downloads.
